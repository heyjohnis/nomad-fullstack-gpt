      "3. Mix everything together until a dough forms. Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 10 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic.\n",
      "4. Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover with a clean towel, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour or until it has doubled in size.\n",
      "5. Punch down the dough and shape it into a loaf. Place the loaf in a greased loaf pan, cover, and let it rise for another 30 minutes.\n",
      "6. Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Bake the bread for about 30-35 minutes or until it is golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom.\n",
